### Building with Faye in Rails 4

A quick aync chat client, ported to Rails 4 from the original RailsCast [Messaging with Faye](http://railscasts.com/episodes/260-messaging-with-faye) screencast.

Due to initializers setting ENV variables, starts the Rails server with `rails s` in one window first, then in another terminal window start up the Faye server like so: `rackup faye.ru -s thin -E production`
